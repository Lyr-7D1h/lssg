# Lyr's Static Site Generator

The idea is to generate static html, css, js files based on markdown.

This uses a custom markdown parser which will not necessarly follow official specifications. I'm making it to the point that it is usable for me, PR's are welcome!

## Roadmap
- Custom markdown modules to integrate specific elements into a page
- Importing pages from notion support
- Code support
- Custom styling support
