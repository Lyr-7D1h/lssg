# Lyr's Static Site Generator

Recursively generate static html, css, js files from a single markdown file.

This uses a custom Markdown parser which will not necessarily follow [official specifications](https://commonmark.org/). I'm making it to support custom html elements inside of the markdown better. Writing a custom parser makes bugs more likely, PR's are welcome!
