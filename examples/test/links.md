I started out with a very basic understanding of algebra and the minimal understanding of Calculus. However even this I hadn't used in a long time so I needed a refresher. I used [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/home/) in order to do this but [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is also a great resource however for me it was a little bit too slow and I didn't really enjoy the exercises and explainer videos. The downside of Brilliant is that sometimes it was going a little bit too fast it focuses a lot on building intuition which is good but to really remember and get a feel for it needs more exercises. So I did the following Brilliant courses for algebra [Algebra I](https://brilliant.org/courses/algebra-extensions/), [Algebra II](https://brilliant.org/courses/graphing-and-modeling/) and [Complex Algebra](https://brilliant.org/courses/complex-algebra/) although you will only use Complex Algebra later on.
