# Creagen: Creative Coding Editor

Creagen stands for Creative Generations. It is a creative coding web editor. Its goal is to provide easy accessibility to make creative coding projects. Its design goals are to be **visually minimalistic**, **powerful**, **fast** and **easy to use**.

It is still under heavy development but I made a preview available at [creagen.lyrx.dev](https://creagen.lyrx.dev)
