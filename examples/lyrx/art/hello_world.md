# Hello World: Random Graph Circles

My first algorithmic art experiments. I use polar coordinates to get uniform (and in a half variation normal around the x-axis) random points on an increasing circle. After I have all these points I select one randomly and draw lines to the next closest neighbor that does not already have 4 connections with a max distance where it will eventually stop.
