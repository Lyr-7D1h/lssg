# Creative Coding Amsterdam Banner

I was asked to make a banner for the [Creative Coding Amsterdam](https://www.meetup.com/creative-coding-amsterdam/) group. So I wanted to make an art piece literally made out of pieces of code. In the end I used sin wave modulation and a lot of "controlled" randomness and probability to generate these pieces and have each iteration differ slightly from the previous one in every way.
