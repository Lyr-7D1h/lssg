# How to self study mathematics

## Introduction

Let me start out by saying, you're going to need a whole lot of self dicipline and dedication to get this done properly. This means that if you don't have the drive to really persevere you're probrably going to give up. However if you make it through the countless hours of struggling it will be more than worth it. 

As a self taught software engineer I sometimes feel like I'm missing out on a proper education and that I'm lacking the proper theory for certain things. I always knew that in the early days computer systems were designed and build by mathematicians and that mathematical concepts are spread all over computer science. So for me this was reason enough to really start learning the actual mathematics underlining the systems I use on a day to day basis. Mathematics however is so much more.

## Starting from highschool algebra



## The juicy bit

So what you are going to learn depends on what you want to use it for. However there are some basics that you're definitely going to need. 

## Advanced

## When you get stuck

So you're definitely going to get stuck or have trouble understanding some topic. It is very important NOT to ignore this topic and to move on. This will most likely haunt you in the future when you're working on a more advanced topic using something that you might have ignored (Math is all about building on previously taught topics).
