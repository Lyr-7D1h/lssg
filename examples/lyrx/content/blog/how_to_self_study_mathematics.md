# How to self study mathematics

## Background

I have been self studying mathematics for around 2 years. I started out with a very basic and vague highschool math understanding and worked my way towards understanding multivariable calculus and linear algebra. This hasn't come easy and there were many strugles along the way. My goal here is to show you the things that helped me and to share the best resources I've found along the way.

## Introduction

As a self taught software engineer I sometimes feel like I'm missing out on a proper education and that I'm lacking the proper theory for certain things. I always knew that in the early days computer systems were designed and build by mathematicians and that mathematical concepts are spread all over computer science. So for me this was reason enough to really start learning the actual mathematics underlining the systems I use on a day to day basis. Mathematics however is so much more.

> **Word of Warning**
> You're going to need a whole lot of self dicipline and dedication to get this done properly. This means that if you don't have the drive to really persevere you're probrably going to give up. However if you make it through the countless hours of struggling it will be more than worth it. You have to stay curious and geniuly interested. After all the foundation of modern world is mathematics.

## Starting from highschool algebra

I started out with a very basic understanding of algebra and the minimal understanding of Calculus. However even this I hadn't used in a long time so I needed a refresher. I used [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/home/) in order to do this but [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is also a great resource however for me it was a little bit too slow and I didn't really enjoy the exercises and explainer videos. The downside of Brilliant is that sometimes it was going a little bit too fast (or I was too stubborn to look at solutions and struggled for prollonged times) the fix for this is to use things like . So I did the following Brilliant courses for algebra [Algebra I](https://brilliant.org/courses/algebra-extensions/) and [Algebra II](https://brilliant.org/courses/graphing-and-modeling/)

## Calculus

So what you are going to learn depends on what you want to use it for. However there are some basics that you're definitely going to need. 

## Linear Algebra


## When you get stuck

So you're definitely going to get stuck or have trouble understanding some topic. It is very important NOT to ignore this topic and to move on. This will most likely haunt you in the future when you're working on a more advanced topic build on something that you might have ignored (Math is all about building on previously taught topics).

When you get stuck it can be because either you don't know where some solution came from and which steps were made or you don't understand what is asked or in general what is going on. In the former case you can use [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) and if you have the Pro subscription you can look at how it calculated the solutions, this has saved me countless times, although try to avoid it whenever you can calculating things by hand can really strengthen intiution. In the latter case you can use things like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to ask for specific questions and nudge you in the right direction. Ask it about the things you don't understand in a question and piece by piece desect everything you need to know to answer something you're working on. Have patience!
