## Introduction

In this post Iâ€™ll try to explain how to make a controller for putting wled software on. This will be a more practical guide with specifically chosen components compared to the [generic explanation on the wled website.](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/getting-started/)

## Requirements

- Laptop
- Solder kit
- 3d printer
- Any [wled compatible led strip](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/compatible-led-strips/)
